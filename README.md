## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


Once in a while it is important for us as developers to go back to what made us excited about computers in the first place. For Derek Jensen, that is gaming. Games are what originally brought him to the world of computers and everytime he reaches back to that point in his life, he learns something that he wants to share with the Tuts+ community. Today, he wants to share SpriteKit and the world of infinite runner style games.

If you are just starting coding games for iOS, it may seem like a lot to learn. But with a few basic skills, some math, and some determination, you can begin to create games—whether just for you or for sharing with everyone out in the App Store. So grab your Mac, and let's start coding a game from scratch with Derek.
